title: "Why I Built This Hub"
date: "2025-12-08"
summary: "I’m into a lot: gaming, soccer, Pokémon, art, and building tools. Instead of pretending they’re separate, this hub is where I mash them together and track the journey."

I’ve always had my interests split across different apps and platforms:

- Soccer clips in one place  
- Gaming content somewhere else  
- Pokémon binder pics buried in my camera roll  
- Tech projects hiding in random repos  

This site is my attempt to pull everything into one **central hub** I actually own.

I want a place where I can:

- Log what I’m working on
- Share small tools and templates
- Track progress in soccer, gaming, and collecting
- Experiment with art and design

It’s not meant to be a perfect “finished” portfolio.  
It’s a live workspace where I’m allowed to ship rough ideas, improve them in public, and keep moving.

If you’re seeing this early, you’re catching version 0.1 of the whole thing. 😅
