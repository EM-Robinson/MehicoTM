title: "Phase 1: Just Ship Something"

summary: "Done > perfect. I shipped version 0.1 of this hub on purpose, even if nothing is 'finished' yet. Momentum is the goal right now."

Most projects die before they launch.

Not because they’re bad ideas, but because the builder tries to make **version 1** look like **version 10**. They spend weeks on logos, fonts, layouts, naming, and polishing something nobody has even seen yet.

This time I’m doing it differently.

**I shipped a half-finished site on purpose.**

---

## The Idea
I’m into a lot of different things:

- training for soccer and trying to get my fitness back
- grinding Apex and EA FC on the side
- collecting Pokémon cards like a 12-year-old with a credit card
- building tools and tiny apps I’ll probably use alone at first
- drawing random art in Procreate even though I’m no expert

Every one of those things lives in its own world:

- clips on my phone
- spreadsheets hidden in folders
- notes inside Apple Notes
- half-built apps buried in repos
- Pokémon binder pics sitting in my camera roll

So this site is my attempt to pull everything into **one hub I actually own**, where I can share my progress instead of letting it die in storage.

Not a portfolio.  
Not a highlight reel.

A **log**.

## Why I Shipped Early
Because waiting for “perfect” is an excuse to never start.

This version is intentionally basic:

- 5 simple pages
- one markdown blog post
- no fancy animations
- no headless CMS
- no official branding yet
- no YouTube links
- no soccer data
- no real art section

And still, it’s better than **zero**.

I can open the browser and see something **real** I made.  
That instantly makes me want to keep going.

“If it exists, I want to improve it.”

## What I Learned While Shipping
A few things hit me while building this:

### **1. You become motivated by movement**
As soon as the first version was live, my brain switched into:

- What’s next?
- This is possible.
- Let’s add something.

Momentum is addictive.

### **2. Tiny wins stack faster than planning**
I could’ve spent a week planning the site.
Instead, I spent two nights building it and four minutes deploying it.

### **3. Breaking things teaches faster than tutorials**
I actually broke the app with markdown parsing 🙃
Fixing it forced me to learn more than any YouTube tutorial would’ve.

### **4. Version numbers help**
This is **v0.1**.
Nobody expects v0.1 to be flawless.

So instead of hiding it until it looks “professional,” I’d rather:

- launch now
- show the process
- and level it up in public

---

## The Roadmap for Next Versions
Not everything here needs to be complicated. The plan is to ship **small**:

**v0.2**
- second blog post
- add a link or two per niche
- refine the UI a bit

**v0.3**
- soccer dashboard prototype
- basic match log

**v0.4**
- Apex/FC settings page
- first art experiments posted

**v0.5**
- Pokémon collection view
- grading predictions

After that?

Who knows.  
I’ll follow curiosity.

## The Real Goal of This Hub
It’s not about followers or trying to go viral right now.

It’s about having a place where I can:

- show progress instead of perfection
- track what I’m learning
- build tools that help me get better
- document the journey for my future self

If other people find it helpful or entertaining along the way, that’s a bonus.

But the primary mission is internal:

**I want to see myself improving across all the things I love.**

---

## Closing Thoughts
There’s a line I’m going to keep in my head for the rest of this project:

> **Make it real, then make it better.**

Version 0.1 is real.  
Now I get to make it better.

Thanks for reading.  
If you’re here early, you’re watching the build from the ground up.
